Can ISPs and P2P Users Cooperate for Improved Performance?
	On the one hand, P2P system applications have resulted
	in an increase in revenue for ISPs, as they are one of the major
	reasons cited by Internet users for upgrading their Internet access
	to broadband [6]. On the other hand, ISPs find that P2P traffic
	poses a significant traffic engineering challenge [4, 7].
	
	P2P traffic
	often starves other applications like Web traffic of bandwidth [8],
	and swamps the ISP network. This is because most P2P systems
	rely on application layer routing based on an overlay topology on
	top of the Internet, which is largely independent of the Internet routing
	and topology [9].
	
	To construct an overlay topology, unstructured P2P networks
	usually employ an arbitrary neighbor selection procedure [5]. This
	can result in a situation where a node in Frankfurt downloads a
	large content file from a node in Sydney, while the same information
	may be available at a node in Berlin.
	
	It has been shown that
	P2P traffic often crosses network boundaries multiple times [9, 10].
	This is not necessarily optimal as most network bottlenecks in the
	Internet are assumed to be either in the access network or on the
	links between ISPs, but not in the backbones of the ISPs [11].
	
	Besides,
	studies have shown that the desired content is often available
	“in the proximity” of interested users [10, 12].
	
	
	To better understand the origin of the problem of overlay-underlay
	routing clash, let us consider how routing works in the Internet and
	P2P systems. In the Internet, which is a collection of Autonomous
	Systems (ASes), packets are forwarded along a path on a per-prefix
	basis. This choice of path via the routing system is limited by
	the contractual agreements between ASes and the routing policy
	within the AS (usually shortest path routing based on a fixed per
	link cost) [13].
	
	P2P systems, on the other hand, setup an overlay topology and
	implement their own routing [14] in the overlay topology which is
	no longer done on a per-prefix basis but rather on a query or key
	basis. In unstructured P2P networks queries are disseminated, e.g.,
	via flooding [15] or random walks while structured P2P networks
	often use DHT-based routing systems to locate data [5]. Answers
	can either be sent directly using the underlay routing [5] or through
	the overlay network by retracing the query path [15]. By routing
	through the overlay of P2P nodes, P2P systems hope to use paths
	with better performance than those available via the Internet [14,
	16].
	
	In other words, P2P systems
	reinvent and reimplement a routing system whose dynamics should
	be able to interact with the dynamics of the Internet routing [7, 17].
	
	While we do not know of a P2P network that tries to reverseengineer
	the Internet topology, there are some proposals that suggest
	that P2P networks should bias their overlay topology by choosing
	neighbors that are close in the sense of high throughput or low
	latency, e.g., [18, 19, 20] or that are within the same AS, e.g., [10,
	21].
	
	Others such as the Brocade [22] system propose to build an
	overlay on top of a structured DHT P2P system that exploits knowledge
	of the underlying network characteristics. Yet another system
	[8] proposes to use caching to relieve the tension between ISPs
	and P2P systems.

Pitfalls for ISP-Friendly P2P Design
	Network oblivious sharing increases costs for ISPs. As
	demand increases on transit links, backbone ISPs are forced
	to invest in increasing capacity. These costs are passed
	on to edge ISPs that pay transit costs proportional to the
	amount of interdomain traffic they generate. Many customer
	facing ISPs, however, offer flat-rate pricing, forcing
	them to absorb the costs externalized by P2P file sharing.
	In response, some ISPs have elected to rate-limit or simply
	block these “problem” protocols [4, 14], in turn leading
	developers into an arms race to evade restrictions.
	
	Saroiu et al. [17] and Gummadi
	et al. [6] examine the Gnutella and Kazaa workloads,
	document the increasing popularity of P2P systems,
	study the impact of caching and the potential for bandwidth
	savings of a locality aware mechanism.

	Sen and
	Wang [18] perform trace analysis of P2P traffic along the
	border routers of a single ISP and provide data that suggests
	that application-level traffic engineering might help.
	
	For instance, Keralapura et al. [9]
	show that P2P systems could have an adverse impact on
	the stability of traffic engineering techniques currently used
	by ISPs in the absence of cooperation.
	
	The notion of ISPs manipulating existing protocols to
	accomplish traffic engineering goals or for strategic benefit
	has also received attention by researchers.
		Wang et
		al. report widespread use of path prepending to influence
		routing [19]. Mahajan et al. suggest additional protocol
		mechanisms by which ISPs coordinate their actions to overcome
		common inefficiencies in interdomain routing [13],
		but efficient outcomes depend on mutual trust between
		ISPs. More recently, Goldberg et al. [5] examine the incentives
		for ISPs to manipulate routing announcements
		to attract generic revenue-generating traffic and find that
		ensuring honesty likely requires substantial restriction in
		policy freedom. 
		
		We apply similar ideas to the interaction
		between ISPs and P2P applications and quantify the potential
		for increasing revenue with measured workloads.

		simulate a BitTorrent swarm with detailed peer behaviors, e.g., the choke algorithm with the tit-for-tat
		policy. In addition, we simulate the concrete implementations of locality awareness mechanisms
		currently under discussion, i.e., BNS, BU, and the combination of both. In this way we show that
		different implementations lead to a different application performance, which is neglected in Piatek
		et al. [14].

Improving Traffic Locality in BitTorrent via Biased Neighbor Selection
	Mielenkiintoiset kohdat jossa viitattiin
		P2P content distribution applications such as BitTorrent
		[5] have fundamental advantages over the traditional
		client-server model (i.e. web sites) and the fixedinfrastructure
		content distribution networks (i.e. Akamai)
		as the supply of bandwidth grows linearly with the demand.
	
		BitTorrent is therefore
		wildly popular and a major constituent of traffic on the
		Internet [7, 2].
		
		An ISP typically pays a tier-1 “core” ISP for connectivity
		to the broad Internet, and traffic between the ISP and the
		outside world is costly for the ISP [18].
		
		ISPs often control BitTorrent traffic by “throttling”, or
		bandwidth limiting. Since BitTorrent traffic typically runs
		over a fixed range of ports (6881 to 6889) [6] and is easily
		decoded, traffic shaping devices such as [20, 13, 19, 23] are
		deployed to limit the amount of bandwidth consumed by the
		BitTorrent protocol. However, this mainly slows down the
		content transfer and worsens the user download experience,
		not addressing the fundamental concern of the ISP, which is
		to improve the locality (i.e. reduce the cross-ISP traffic) of
		those transfers.
		
		Many analytical and simulation studies [16, 1, 25, 22]
		have shown that the existing BitTorrent algorithm is nearly
		optimal in terms of user experienced download time.
		
		In addition to bandwidth limiting, two other obvious
		methods for reducing cross-ISP traffic are caches [2], and
		“gateway peers” (a gateway peer is the only node inside 
		an ISP that can connect to external peers) [15].
			A recent
			trace-driven study examined the cross-ISP traffic of the two
			approaches and found that they are comparable [15]. However,
			the study did not look into peer download performance
			
		Measurement studies of BitTorrent traffic on the Internet
		[8, 14, 12] show that a BitTorrent network typically goes
		through three stages in its life: flash crowd, steady state
		and winding down [14], and the peer join rate decreases
		exponentially with time [12].
		
		In recent years, the need
		of ISPs to control P2P traffic has given rise to a new
		category of devices that we call P2P shaping devices.
		Situated along side the edge routers of the ISPs, these
		devices use deep packet inspection to identify P2P traffic
		and manipulate them. Representative vendors include
		CacheLogic [2], Sandvine [23] and Cisco’s PCube
		appliances [19].
		
		The above discussions show that biased neighbor selection
		performs much better than bandwidth throttling, and
		the two techniques can be combined for best results. This
		section examines two other techniques to reduce cross-ISP
		traffic: using a single peer, called “gateway peer”, to connect
		to the external world [15], and using a cache to store
		blocks sent to the ISP [2].
			An ISP can designate a single node inside it as the gateway
			peer. All peers inside the ISP can only connect to each
			other and to the gateway peer, but only the gateway peer
			can connect to the external world. However, as results from
			Table 6 show, gateway peers need to have an upload bandwidth
			that is at least 4x that of normal nodes in the in ISP to
			avoid increasing download times. Moreover, since the gateway
			peer has nothing to gain from the internal peers, because
			of the tit-for-tat mechanism it would rather exchange
			blocks with external peers, benefitting peers in other ISP’s,
			causing them to finish faster (by as much as 20 % in one
			experiment). Finally, this approach is not scalable as the
			gateway requires 400KBps of upload bandwidth for each
			BitTorrent network that nodes from the ISP participate in.
			
		Another approach to eliminate traffic redundancy is to
		use caches. Positioned at the ISP’s gateway to the Internet,
		a cache stores blocks sent by external peers to internal
		peers, and when an internal peer wants to fetch a block from
		an external node, the cache intervenes transparently [2] and
		sends a locally-stored copy to the internal peer.
			Caches also need a high upload bandwidth to avoid increasing
			download times The estimated peak and average
			upload bandwidth needs of caches were obtained by summing
			up the bandwidth of flows crossing the ISP boundary
			that are “intervened” by the cache (see Table 7). Under
			regular BitTorrent, both the peak and average upload
			bandwidths of the cache are high. However, ISPs that deploy
			caches should instead use biased neighbor selection as
			the bandwidth needs of the cache are significantly reduced
			and furthermore, this can still be combined with bandwidth
			throttling.

An adaptable and ISP-friendly multicast overlay network (2019 artsa)
	-Moreover, as their [P2P] implementation happens at
	the application level, their deployment does not depend
	on the ISP technological support. 
	
	Also in the subject of P2P overlay systems and their
	lack of knowledge of the physical network and associated
	routing strategies, an argument can be made as to the
	system’s inefficiency [22]. In fact, the overlay operates on a
	more abstract level, not considering peers placement in the
	network, which may lead data to traverse specific network
	links more than once or even generating excessive inter
	Autonomous System (AS) traffic, where most of the traffic
	bottlenecks are assumed to be in. 
		-Related with this topic,
		in 2008, the IETF created the IETF ALTO working group
		[23], tasked with optimizing the performance of P2P overlay
		systems. This allows, for instance, the ISP to provide the
		overlay system with the physical network topology, via a
		topology graph, enabling the overlay network to perform
		smart decisions. Similarly, this also allows the ISP to 
		better control the overlay traffic in accordance with specific
		traffic engineering policies. 
		-Additional research works also
		involving collaborative efforts between the P2P application
		level and ISPs can be also found in [24–26].

Traffic Management with Bloom-Filter Based Flow Classification
	-P2P networks have also demonstrated considerable potential
	to become a popular network tool for use not only in file
	sharing but also in video streaming [4] or to act as contents
	delivery networks (CDNs) [5] on the Internet
	
	-While there
	is a prediction that P2P traffic for file sharing applications
	will not increase in the future [6], it still represents today a
	significant fraction of the Internet traffic in Asia at present
	[7]
	
	-To remove the redundancy from P2P traffic, we have proposed
	a method to control P2P traffic through a packet-level
	data cache located on the router [ 1], [8]
	
	-The Bloom filter [ 12] has already had various applications
	in SDN [ 17], content-centric networks [ 18], P2P networks [ 19]
	and various network applications [20].

A Novel Optimization Scheme for Caching in Locality-aware P2P Networks (tallennettu pdf ei toimi oikein)
	-However, the hugevolumes of traffic generated by various of P2P applications
	accounts for a large part of the overall Internet traffic and
	is expected to remain a significant source of traffic in thefuture [1].
	
	-Deploying P2P cache [2], [3], [4] is one of the most
	effective way to decrease costly inter-ISP traffic and improve
	users experience since contents in P2P systems are always
	immutable and requests are highly repetitive [5].
	
	-Traditionally, P2P caching algorithms are intended for
	locality-unaware P2P networks, which mainly consider the
	requested frequency of contents as the principle of replacement
	and allocation policies. However, as locality-awareness mech-anisms 
	are generally applied [6], [7], [8], the existing caching
	schemes can hardly optimize the situation.
	
	-In locality-awareconditions, requesting peers always prefer getting connection
	with nearby peers selected by neighbor-selection policies,
	which save the cost of P2P traffic. Nevertheless, if the re-quested 
	contents has not been widely distributed in local area
	yet or the peers possessing the requested contents are in
	poor bandwidths, biased neighbor selection will degrade the
	performance and the robustness of a P2P application [9], [10].
		-Therefore, what need to be cached in locality-aware conditions
		is the content that can not be well provided by local neighbors,
		rather than the content which is requested most frequently
	
	-But according to traditional caching schemes, even though some
	contents have already been widely distributed in local peers,
	they may still be cached due to their high request frequency.
	Apparently, caching these contents is not cost-efficient because
	utilizing plenty of nearby neighbors can get the similar results.
	What’s worse, current bandwidth management of P2P cache
	tends to allocate less bandwidth to swarms (all peers that
	distribute the same content called a swarm) with a high rate
	of local peers [9], [10], which means requesting peers have to
	choose cache with low bandwidth instead of local neighbors
	with high bandwidth. 
		-In this situation, traditional schemes ofP2P cache are causing new congestion
		
	-Moreover, the actual efficiency of a cache depends on
	two factors: storage and bandwidth, but most former studies
	consider these two crucial factors separately. They focus on
	either storage management of cache [5], [11], or bandwidth
	allocation of cache [9], [10] to reduce the inter-ISP traffic.
	However, if storage and bandwidth are allocated dispropor-tionally, 
	one of them will constrain the other, which may cause
	waste of cache resources.
	
	-We carry out series of simulations to
	evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm 
	by con-trast with two representative caching algorithms: Proportional
	Partial Caching algorithm presented in [5] and Smallest-ratio
	Priority algorithm presented in [10]
	
	-Minimizing the negative impact of P2P traffic has drawn 
	significant attentions of networking researchers, which can be
	generally categorized into three classes: traffic limiting, traffic
	caching and traffic localizing
	
	-Traffic limiting mechanism
	imposes bandwidth constraints on P2P traffic once they are
	identified, which highly degrades the performance of P2P
	systems and hence stimulates customers to change their ISPs[12].
	
	-P2P cache has been researched in lots of studies. Storage
	management is the first aspect optimized by researchers.
	M. Hefeedaet al.[5] use a Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution to
	simulate the requested frequency of contents according to theirp
	opularity.
	
	-Based on popularity of contents, various caching
	replacement policies are provided [13], [5], [11]. The biggest
	difference between our work and all other former works is
	that we use not only popularity, but also locality information
	to guide behaviors of cache in locality-aware conditions.
	
	-Bandwidth is another important factor of cache. [14] and
	[15] consider bandwidth management of P2P video streaming
	systems to decrease the incoming traffic.
	
	-More related to ourwork are [9] and [10], in which authors propose series of
	schemes of bandwidth allocation in locality-aware conditions.
	They all conclude that more bandwidth should be allocated to
	the swarm which has less local peers.
	
	-According to previous studies, 86% of requested contents
	are downloaded from peers outside the local network even
	though they were locally available [16].
	
	-Traffic localizing
	attempts to guide peers to get connection with local neighbors.
	Traffic localizing can be organized as peer-driven and ISP-driven. 
	
	-Peer-driven solutions let peers detect unaware local
	information by themselves. TopBT [6] assesses distances be-
	tween peers based on hops of routers obtained from
	traceroute and pingtools. The weakness of peer-driven solutions is that
	they can not guarantee the accuracy, so ISP-driven is proposed
	to get the precise networks information
	
	-Oracle [7] presented
	by Deutsche Telekom Laboratories can collect various topol-
	ogy information of ISP networks, such as AS number, AS-level topology, 
	POP-level topology, even city-level topology
	and so on.
	
	-Although traffic localizing is expected to reach a
	win-win situation for both ISPs and users, 
	Lehriederet al.[17] point out that users experience can hardly get improved
	in realistic conditions. Skewed peer distributions and hetero-
	geneous access bandwidths of swarms have significant impact
	on effectiveness of traffic localizing. In this paper, we show
	that this drawback of locality-aware selection can be made up
	by cache.
	
	-In summary, traffic caching and traffic localizing are two
	main approaches to decrease the high cost of tremendous
	P2P traffic. In terms of caching, locality information is rarely
	considered. Two crucial factors of cache, storage and band-
	width, are always allocated separately. Traffic localizing can
	collect various of locality information to recommend optimal
	neighbors for requesting peers, but skewed peer distributions
	and heterogeneous access bandwidths will highly degrade
	users experience. These problems are also the motivation of
	our work.

Network pricing: can both ISP and P2P benefit?
    Internet service providers offer users access to the Internet and related services. 
	There are roughly twotiers of ISPs according to the range of services provided:
	localISPs that provide services in smallregions to end-users and
	transitISPs that transfer data between local ISPs [1].

    In recent years,although  easily  accessible  streaming  media  such  as  Netflix  
	and  YouTube  have  led  to  a  downward
	trend in P2P file sharing of movie and music, P2P systems such as BitTorrent 
	still dominate upstream traffic with36:35% as of 2013 [5].

    Some recent findings show signs ofthe resurgence of P2P while moving P2P service to the cloud via the notion of a ‘seedbox’ [9].

    Because of theincreased load and changing traffic patterns resulting from the large amount of traffic generated [6],especially the upstream bandwidth requirements by P2P, ISPs have been under significant pressure ontheir maximum link capacity to domains outside of their local networks, that is, their bottleneck linkcapacity

    ISPs’ common actions to block or degrade certain applications (e.g. BitTorrent) [10,11] andattempts to differentiate traffic [12] are all signalling the bandwidth scarcity suffered by ISPs.

    This leaves the ISPs with few choices: they are either forced to expand capacities, to throttle certaintypes of traffic, or to change their business model (including the introduction of bandwidth caps andtiered-usage pricing). In recent years, ISPs have begun shifting towards usage-based pricing that offerscustomers a fixed amount of data each month for a fee. On average, less than 2% of users exceedthe  most  commonly  used  tier  of  300 GB;  nearly  80%  of  consumers  never  exceed  even  50 GB  permonth [15].

    There has been research about the rising tension between P2P and ISPs. Peer Coordination Protocol[27] was developed for ISP-compliant P2P systems, which puts a dynamic rate limit on P2P trafficbased on an ISPs’ constraint.
    
    Application-layer traffic optimization studies how to provide the righttype  of  network  layer  topology  information  to  the  requesting  peer  to  enable  P2P  data  structure  toimprove performance while reducing the utilization of the underlying network infrastructure [32,33].

    In [34], researchers conducted a simulation study to examine how localizing P2P traffic within networkboundaries impacts the profitability of ISPs. They found that the benefits of localization must not betaken for granted.

    Wanget al. [35] modelled the peering and routing tussle between ISPs and P2Papplications  and  analysed  the  economic  implications  of  overlay  traffic  on  ISPs’  peering  decisions.

The Performance and Locality Tradeoff inBitTorrent-like P2P File-Sharing Systems
    The large volumes of P2P traffic in today’s Internet have sig-nificantly changed the Internet traffic pattern and dramaticallyincreased the traffic-relay cost at the ISPs. Such a cost threathas led to ISPs’ packet filtering and rate throttling towardsP2Ptraffic [1], while on the other hand P2P application providersreact  by  encrypting  data  and  communicating  with  dynamicports to prevent from being recognized [2].

    There have recentlyemerged  hot  arguments  that  such  a  conflict  cannot  lead  todesirable outcomes for both parties. Instead, traffic localizationdesigns  have  been  proposed  that  connect  peers  to  nearby(local) neighbors in terms of delay, routing hop count, etc.,byapproaches  at  either  the  P2P  application  side  [3],  [4]  or  ISPside [5], or based on collaborations between both parties [6]

    While such local peer selection is effective in reducing P2Ptraffic across network boundaries, it may unfavorably degradethe downloading performance at peers in a BitTorrent-like file-sharing system [7], as local peers may not necessarily be onesthat  can  supply  large  upload  bandwidths.  In  another  word,  anon-negligible  tradeoff  may  exist  between  the  downloadingperformance and the traffic localization in the system.
