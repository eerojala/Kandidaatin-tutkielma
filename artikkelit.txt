		Abstract
			With the emergence of BitTorrent, Swarm-cast, and CDNs, peer-assisted file distribution has become a prominent Internet application, both in terms of user popularity and 
			traffic volumes. We consider the following fundamental problem for peer-assisted file distribution. 
			-There are seed nodes, each of which has a copy of the file, and leecher nodes, each of which wants a copy the file. 
			-The goal is to distribute the file to all the leechers - with the assistance of the upload capacity of the leechers - in order to minimize the time to get the file to all 
			the leechers (the distribution time). 
			-We obtain explicit expressions for the minimum distribution time of a general heterogeneous peer-assisted file distribution system. 
			-Derived with fluid-flow arguments, the expressions are in terms of the file size, the seeds' upload rates and the leechers' upload and download rates. 
			-We demonstrate the utility of the result by comparing the optimal distribution time with the measured distribution time when BitTorrent is used to distribute a file from a 
			seed to ten leechers
			
		Introduction
			-Clearly, peer-assisted file distribution has become an important application paradigm in the Internet.
			-But, quantitatively, just how good is it at distributing afile?
				-Can it be significantly better than client/serverdistribu-tion?
				-How well can it scale as the number of receiving nodes becomes very large?
				-How does the interaction of server upload bandwidth, receiving node upload bandwidth, and receiving node download bandwidth impact the overall distribution time?
				
			-In this paper, we address fundamental questions like these lying at the core of peer-assisted file distribution.

		Abstract
			-ISPs manage performance of their networks in the presence of failures or congestion by employing common traffic engineering techniques such as link weight set-tings, 
			load balancing and routing policies. 
			-Overlay net-works attempt to take control over routing in the hopethat they might achieve better performance for suchfailures or high load episodes. 
			-In this paper, we examinesome of the interaction dynamics between the two layersof control from an ISP’s view. 
			-With the help of simpleexamples, we illustrate how an uncoordinated effort ofthe two layers to recover from failures may cause per-formance degradation for both overlay 
			and non-overlaytraffic.  
			-We also show how current traffic engineeringtechniques are inadequate to deal with emerging over-lay network services.
			
		Introduction
			-Can overlay networks and underlying IP networks form a synergistic co-existence?
			-Using simple illustrations, we identify numerous is-sues that result in potentially harmful interactions andmake the case for future research in this direction
			-Note that this paper is not about performance issue smeasured by the classic metrics such as loss, delay orthroughput. Instead we are interested in understanding how the 
			network management techniques currently de-ployed by ISPs are impacted by overlay networks
			
		Discussions
			-We have identified five problematic interactions that can occur between IP networks and overlay networks:
			-(i) traffic matrices become more dynamic and more am-biguous, making them harder to estimate; 
			-(ii) sometypes of load balancing policies can be bypassed; 
			-(iii)multiple overlays can get synchronized, which in turnleads to traffic oscillations that can last for varyingamounts of time; 
			-(iv) oscillations can impact non-overlaytraffic; and 
			-(v) different ASes can get coupled due toper-domain events		
			
			
		-Artikkelin pointit
			-ISPt tekevät oletuksia verkkoliikenteestä, hoitavat reitityksen
				-Jos päällysverkot mielivaltaisesti reitittvät voivat hankaloittaa ISPn omaa reititystä
				
			-Ongelmallista jos kahdella eri tasolla tehdään reititystä (sovellus = Päällysverkot, verkko = palveluntarjoajat), kun molemmat eivät ole tietoisia toisistaan
				Voivat luoda traffic oscillaatioita
				
				If overlay networks react to events in the IP
				network (e.g., failures or congestion) independently of
				an ISP, race conditions could occur and lead to traf-
				¯c oscillations. Such tra±c oscillations not only a®ect
				the overlay tra±c but also impact the background (non-
				overlay) tra±c in the network. We also show that such
				reactions by overlay networks that span multiple do-
				mains could threaten the e®ectiveness of BGP in isolat-
				ing di®erent domains in the Internet
				
			-ISPt tekevät kaksi oletusta (jotka eivät päde päällysverkkoihin) tehdessään traffic engineeringiä
				-(i) liikennevaatimukset eivät vaihtele suuresti lyhyillä aikaväleillä
				-(ii) Muutokset reiteissä (path) domainin sisällä eivät vaikuta liikennevaatimuksiin

			-Haasteet traffic engineeringille
				-3.1 Traffic Matrixin estimointi
					-Matrixia pitää estimoida usein päällysverkkojen reitityksen takia
					-There are many °ows whose ultimate destination lies
					outside the ISPs' domain; the tra±c from these °ows
					traverses the ISP and thus appears inside the TM. The
					tra±c matrix will specify an exit router within the ISP's
					domain for such °ows. If this tra±c belongs to an
					overlay network that spans multiple domains, and uses
					its own path selection mechanism, then the exit point
					within a single ISP domain could change, resulting in a
					shift in TM entry.
					
					-Eli aiheuttaa TM entry duplikaatiota ja tm entry shiftejä
					
				-3.2 Kuorman tasaus (load balancing)
					-Päällysverkot eivät välitä ISPn omasta kuormantasauksesta
					
			-Race conditions in multiple overlay networks
				-Jos alusverkolla on useampi päällysverkko, niin performanssin heikkeneminen laukaisee niissä kaikissa reitityksen muutoksia
					-Two or more overlays reacting at moments that are
					close in time can result in race conditions. Having rout-
					ing control in two layers in the network is equivalent to
					having two closed loop systems reacting simultaneously
					yet independently to the same set of events. This is a
					classic situation for race conditions that lead to tra±c
					oscillations.
					
					-esim. päällysverkot huomaavat reitin sammuneen samaanaikaan ja päätyvät samaan reititysratkaisuun niin nopeasti että eivät kerkeä havaitsemaan toistensa ratkaisujen 
					vaikutusta
						-johtaa tilanteeseen jossa uusi reitti kärsii molempien päällysverkkojen liikenteestä
						-Verkot huomaavat taas tämän tilanteet ja muuttavat samanaikaisesti liikenteensä kulkemaan toisen saman reitin kautta
							-Syntyy oskillatiota (=toistuva tilanne?) kunnes toinen päällysverkoista on nopeampi, rikkoen deadlocking
								-Deadlockin rikkoutuminen = disentangling
							
						-Verkot siis synkronoituvat
						
					-Oskillaatio vaikuttaa selvästi myös muuhun liikenteeseen, ei pelkästään päällysverkkojen liikenteeseen
						-Koska päällysverkot ruuhkauttavat reittejä
					
				-Oskillaatioita laukaisevia tekijöitä
					-Link or node failure
					-IGP convergence
					-Congestion (high loads)
					
				-Oskillaation lopettavat tekijät
					-Self-disentangling
					-Failure restoration
					
				-Monien eri laukasevien ja lopettavien tekijöiden kombinaatio mahdollistaa monenlaisia oskillaatioskenaarioita ja niille eri pituuksia
				
			-Coupling of multiple domains
				-1) Kun päällysverkko ylttää useamman ISPn domainin päälle, aiheuttaa yhden domainin tilanne muiden domainien tilanteeseen
				-2) Yksi BGPn tavoitteesta on decouplaa eri domaineja jotta yhden domainin tapahtumat eivät vaikuttaisi toiseen
					-Päällysverkot haittaavat tätä tavoitetta kun ne päällystävät useampaa domainia
						-Tällöin tapahtuma yhdessä domainissa aiheuttaa vaikutuksia muissa
						
			-Loppupohdinnat
				-ISPiden on tärkeää ottaa huomioon päällysverkot jotta voisivat antaa parempaa palvelua kaikille
					-Tutkimuksen skenaariot osoittavat että mikäli näin ei tehdä, mainitut ongelmat laajenevat päällysverkkojen yleistyessä
				
				-ISP voisivat miettiä miten kannustaa päällysverkkoja välttämään ongelmallista reitityskäytöstä
					-Myös tärkeää että päällysverkot tiedostavat aiheuttamansa ongelmat ja pyrkivät myös itse välttämään niitä
			
				
				
		-Artikkeli ei käsittele ongelmia suoraan performanssin näkökulmasta, vaan miten päällysverkot vaikuttavat ISPiden verkonhallintatekniikoihin
			
		-Oletus, että ISPt eivät ottaisi P2P liikennettä mitenkään erityisesti huomioon (ei vissiin päde enään, mutta teoreettinen lähtökohta jota voisi tarkastella)

		Abstract
			-In this work, we explore the potential impact of future P2P file delivery mechnanisms as seen from three perspectives
				-i) The content providers
				-ii) the ISPs
				-iii) Individual content consumers
						
			-We quantify the impact of peer-assisted file delivery on end-user experience and resource consumption
				-We further compare it with the performance expected from traditional distribution mechanisms based on large server farms and Content Distribution Networks (CDN)
				
			-While existing P2P content distribution solutions may provide significant benefits for content providers and end-consumers in terms of cost and performance, our results 
			demonstrate that they have an adverse impact on ISPs’costs by shifting the associated capacity requirements from the content providers and CDNs to the ISPs themselves.
				-Further, we highlight how simple “locality-aware” P2P de-livery solutions can significantly alleviate the induced costat the ISPs, while providing an overall performance that 
				ap-proximates that of a perfect world-wide caching infrastruc-ture.
				
		Introduction
			-The highlights of our work can be summarized in thefollowing points:
				•We provide a detailed study that sheds light on andquantifies the impact of peer-assisted content distrib-ution solutions on ISPs based on real Internet traces.
				•We present evidence that establish the potential forlocality-aware “peer-assisted” solutions. 
					-We estimateand quantify file-availability and user-overlap in timewhere such solutions are feasible.
				
				•We describe easily deployable architectures for effi-cient peer-assisted content distribution. 
					-For each case,we quantify the benefits and highlight potential sav-ings.

		Conclusion
			-Based on payload packet traces as well as tracker-basedlogs, we have studied the impact that local-aware peer-assisted content distribution solutions can have on ISPs, 
			content providers,  and end-users.   
				-In particular, wehave identified that current P2P solutions are very ISP-unfriendly, generating large amount of unnecessary trafficboth downstream as well as upstream.
			
			-We studied locality in the context of BitTorrent.  
				-Ourtraces indicate that BitTorrent is locality-unaware, severelyincreasing ISPs’ bandwidth requirements. 
				In particular, upto 70-90% ofexisting localcontent was found to be down-loaded from external peers

			-Peer-assisted content distribution incurs significant up-stream capacity costs for the transit links (roughly dou-bling the bandwidth requirements). 
				-However, simple local-ity based mechanisms can rectify this effect, approximatingthe performance of a perfect caching architecture. 
				-Overall,locality-aware peer-assisted algorithms decrease the band-width of the content provider’s egress link by more than afactor of two. 
				-Strategies such as those used by BitTorrenttrying to match users with similar capacities provide littlelocality benefits.
				
			-The benefits of a peer-assisted locality solution increasewith the logarithm of the number of active users. 
				-Our find-ings show that as soon as there are more than 30 activeusers within an ISP, a peer-assisted locality solution pro-vides more than 60% savings in terms of ISP’s 
				ingress traf-fic compared to a client/server distribution.
				
			-On the contrary, a peer-assisted locality-aware solutiongenerates five times more traffic on average through theISP’s link than a perfect caching solution.  
				-However, inabsolute terms this represents only a small fraction of thetraffic generated by a client/server solution
				
			-The benefits of a peer-assisted solution are always muchmore pronounced in terms of95thpercentile, thus, absorb-ing peak loads and reducing the monetary impact on ISPsand 
			content providers. 
				-Simple locality-aware mechanismsbased on domain-name grouping, or prefix grouping pro-vide roughly 50% of the potential benefits.
				
			-Our study shows that while current peer-assisted contentdistribution solutions are ISP-unfriendly, this is not a fun-damental limitation and that minor modifications can 
			in-deed significantly reduce the costs of all parties involvedin the content distribution process. 
				-Such simple modifica-tions to peer-assisted protocols can provide a cost-effectivesolution that can be exploited by content providers to scaleand accelerate the delivery 
				of content to millions of userswithout pushing ISPs towards regulating or blocking suchtraffic.

		Abstract
			-Peer-to-peer  (P2P) systems,  which are  realized  as overlayson top of theunderlying Internet routing architecture, contribute a significant portion oftoday’s Internet 
			traffic.  
			-While the P2P users are a good source of revenuefor the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the immense P2P traffic also posesa significant traffic engineering challenge 
			to the ISPs.  
				-Thisis because P2Psystems either implement their own routing in the overlay topology or mayuse a P2P routing underlay [1], both of which are largely independent  
				ofthe Internet routing, and thus impedes the ISP’s traffic engineering capabil-ities.  
				
			-On the other hand, P2P users are primarily interestedin finding theirdesired content quickly, with good performance. 
			-But as the P2P system hasno access to the underlying network, it either has to measurethe path per-formance itself or build its overlay topology agnostic of the underlay.  
			Thissituation is disadvantageous for both the ISPs and the P2P users.
			-To overcome this, we propose and evaluate the feasibility ofa solutionwhere  the  ISP  offers  an  “oracle”  to  the  P2P  users.   
				-When  the  P2Pusersupplies the oracle with a list of possible P2P neighbors, the oracle ranksthem according to certain criteria, like their proximity tothe user or 
				higherbandwidth links.  
				-This can be used by the P2P user to choose appropriateneighbors,  and  therefore  improve  its  performance.   
				-The ISP  can  use thismechanism to better manage the immense P2P traffic, e.g., to keep it insideits  network,  or to  direct  it  along  a  desired  path.   
				-The  improved  networkutilization will also enable the ISP to provide better service to its customers
				
		Introduction
			-However, the wide-spread use of such P2P systems has put ISPsin a dilemma!  
				-On the one hand, P2P system applications have re-sulted in an increase in revenue for ISPs, as they are one of the ma-jor reasons cited by Internet users for 
				upgrading their Internet ac-cess to broadband [6]. 
				-On the other hand, ISPs find that P2P trafficposes a significant traffic engineering challenge [4, 7]. 
					-P2Ptrafficoften starves other applications like Web traffic of bandwidth [8],and swamps the ISP network.  
						-This is because most P2P systemsrely on application layer routing based on an overlay topology ontop of the Internet, which is largely independent of the 
						Internet rout-ing and topology [9]
						-To  construct  an  overlay  topology,  unstructured  P2P  networksusually employ an arbitrary neighbor selection procedure [5]. 
							-Thiscan  result  in  a  situation  where  a  node  in  Frankfurt  downloadsalarge content file from a node in Sydney, while the same informa-tion may be 
							available at a node in Berlin
							
			-We, in this paper, propose and evaluate the feasibility of a sim-pler solution where ISPs help P2P systems by offering anoracleservice.   
				-The oracle acts like an abstract  routing  underlay  to theoverlay network but as it is a service offered by the ISP it hasdi-rect access to the relevant information 
				and does not have to inferor measure it. 
				-For example, an ISP knows whether a customer hasa DSL broadband or a modem connection, its link delay, etc.  
				-Thebenefit  to the ISP is twofold:  first,  it can now influence the P2Prouting decisions via the oracle and so regain its ability toperformtraffic engineering  
				(control  the  traffic flow)  and  second,  theP2Pmeasurement traffic to infer network distances is omitted. 
				-The P2Pusers benefit as explained below

		Abstract
			-As peer-to-peer (P2P) emerges as a major paradigm for scalable network application design, it also exposes significant new challenges in achieving efficient and fair 
			utilization of Internet network resources. 
			-Being largely network-oblivious, many P2P applications may lead to inefficient network resource usage and/or low application performance. 
			-In this paper, we propose a simple architecture called P4P to allow for more effective cooperative traffic control between applications and network providers. 
			-We conducted extensive simulations and real-life experiments on the Internet to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of P4P. 
			-Our experiments demonstrated that P4P either improves or maintains the same level of application performance of native P2P applications, while, at the same time, it 
			substantially reduces network provider cost compared with either native or latency-based localized P2P 

		Introduction
			-This paper focuses on the Internet traffic control problem – how network applications (i.e., network resource consumers) efficientlyand fairly utilize the network resources 
			owned by network providers.
			-In the current Internet, traffic control is largely the responsibil-ity of only the network providers (i.e.,  Internet service providersor ISPs).
				-Applications specify only the destinations of traffic
				
			-The emerging P2P applications, however, expose significant new challenges to Internet traffic control
				-Given that a P2P client interested in a piece of data can download it from a number of loca-tions, there is much flexibility in choosing the data sources. 
					-Thisflexibility is one of the key factors contributing to the robustnessand scalability of the P2P paradigm. 
						
				-However, this flexibility also fundamentally changes the network traffic control problem:  
					-in thetraditional setting, the traffic control problem is typically solved inthe context of a given traffic demand pattern
					-in the new setting,there are multiple ways of satisfying the data demands of an ap-plication, each resulting in a different demand pattern and therebynetwork 
					efficiency
					
				-Being largely network-oblivious, many P2P ap-plications may lead to substantial network inefficiency
				
		Conclusion
			-We presented P4P, a simple andflexible framework to enable ex-plicit cooperation between P2P and network providers. 
			-Our evalu-ations demonstrate that it can be a promising approach to improveboth application  performance  and  provider  efficiency.   
			-There  aremany avenues for further study.  
			-In particular, we are conductingmore experiments on interdomain traffic control. 
			-Improving scala-bility using virtual coordinate embedding and evaluating the effectsof caching are topics under study.  
			-Our overall objective is to inte-grate fairness, congestion management, and efficiency control

		Similar
		in spirit to this work, the P4P [37] project attempts to address
		the problem through custom trackers, both for ISPs and P2P
		systems, using an interface based on a primal-dual decomposition
		of an optimization problem. This interface design simplifies
		the realization of traffic-engineering objectives from each parties’
		perspective and ensures the extensibility of the approach.
		
		
		A clear advantage of these proposals is that they
		allow ISPs to incorporate aggregated traffic policies in their tracker
		recommendations (e.g., a particular traffic balance ratio between
		peering providers). However, all of them require deployments
		of oracles for each participating ISP and their effectiveness is
		ultimately predicated on their adoption by P2P applications and a
		trust relationship between P2P users and their ISPs.

			-Painotettu vertaisvalinta (biased peer selection) (BitTorrentille)
				-Testaavat simulaatioilla
					-We rely on simulations since it is difficult to
					capture all the relevant mechanisms in BitTorrent clients in
					an analytical model
					
					-Different from other simulation studies [1, 15],
					the simulator does not assume that the bottleneck link is the

				• As long as the original seed (the host that starts sharing
				the file) has moderately high upload bandwidth
				(e.g. four times the prevailing upload bandwidth of the
				peers), biased neighbor selection results in no degradation
				in download times, regardless of whether it is
				deployed by all ISPs or by just one ISP.
				
				• Under biased neighbor selection, the cross-ISP traffic
				due to downloading of a particular file stays relatively
				constant, and does not grow as the number of peers
				interested in the file increases. In fact, as the number
				of peers inside an ISP increases, the traffic is reduced
				slightly.
				
				• The “rarest first replication” algorithm is key to the
				success of biased neighbor selection. It has a “declustering”
				effect, improving the chances that peers
				within the same ISP have blocks to exchange with one
				another. Random piece selection, shown in other studies
				to work just as well in regular BitTorrent [1, 16],
				does not work well with biased neighbor selection.
				Here, “rarest first” refers to the strategy of choosing
				a block to download from the blocks a neighbor has.
				Under this scheme, the block which is least replicated
				among other neighbors is chosen first.
				
				• For a cable modem or DSL ISP, when there are external
				high bandwidth peers, biased neighbor selection
				needs to be combined with bandwidth limiting to keep
				cross-ISP traffic at a minimum level. However, unlike
				pure bandwidth limiting, the combined scheme does
				not increase download time.
				
				• Since each BitTorrent node prefers to upload to neighbors
				which have been giving data to it at a good rate,
				(the “tit-for-tat” mechanism) pure bandwidth limiting
				does push a peer toward intra-ISP peers, and can reduce
				cross-ISP traffic. However, its effect is limited
				by the initial neighbor selection of the peer, and combining
				bandwidth throttling with biased neighbor selection
				is much more effective.
					
				• Allowing only a single peer to connect to the external
				nodes results in a significant increase in download
				time. This means that ordinary peers cannot act
				as gateway peers. Instead, dedicated high-bandwidth
				nodes should be used, and the approach does not scale
				to multiple concurrent BitTorrent networks.
				
				• Using caches inside ISP’s for BitTorrent traffic requires
				them to have high upload bandwidth to avoid
				increasing the download times. Combining biased
				neighbor selection with caches can reduce both the
				peak and average bandwidth needed, and the addition
				of bandwidth limiting can cap the peak bandwidth.

		Abstract
			-Peer-to-peer file sharing applications have become enor-mously popular over the past few years, coming to repre-sent a large fraction of wide-area Internet traffic. 
			-A sideeffect of this explosive growth has been an emerging tus-sle between users, who want fast downloads, and ISPs,whose flat-rate pricing business model is threatened 
			by theextreme volume of P2P traffic. 
			-Because ISP costs scalewith usage while their prices do not, many ISPs have at-tempted to throttle or shut down P2P systems. 
			-Recently,several researchers have proposed that this tussle is unnec-essary, that small changes in client and/or protocol behav-ior can lead to a “win-win" solution of 
			better performancefor end-users with less wide-area traffic for ISPs. 
			-Usinga very large scale trace measurement of BitTorrent usage,we find evidence that such a win-win outcome is unlikelyfor at least one very popular P2P protocol
			
		-Lupaavalta vaikuttava artsa, esittää vasta-argumentteja
			-Lähinnä Onoa vastaan, mutta silti mielenkiintoinen näkökulma
			
		-Artikkelin pointit
			-Client-only ratkaisut eivät auta (ainakaan biased neighbour selection)
				-Käyttäjien performanssi ei parane ja verkkojen välinen liikenne ei vähene (merkittävästi)
				-Azureus-clientin Ono-lisäosa erityisesti ei näytä auttavan
					-Taming the torrent
					
				-Konkreettisia tuloksia bittorrentin tarkastelusta internetissä
				-Syitä:
					-While 33% of Onorecommended
					peers are within a single AS and download
					rates increase by 31% for recommended paths, Ono’s endto-
					end benefit is limited by the vanishingly small fraction
					of peers it recommends as “local”, even when applied to
					new, popular swarms
					
					-Usein ei riittävästi paikallisia vertaisia
						-Download and depart behaviour
						-BitTorrent itsessään ei tarjoa kannustimia
						
					-Vaikka paikallisia vertaisia esiintyisikin, clientti todennäköisemmin suosii kauempia vertaisia joilta mahdollista ladata nopeammin
						-Alla mainittu kaistakapasiteettien epätasaisuus
						
					-Clientti-kohtaisilla ratkaisuilla ei täyttä tietoa samanaikaisista lataajista
						-Tehokkuuden maksimointi riippuu vertaisten matchaamisesta globaalilla tasolla

			-Performanssin ja päällysverkon eheyden heikkeneminen
				-Mikäli optimoidaan pelkästään paikallisuutta ajatellen

				-Oraakkeli-paperissa tutkittiin myös lokaliteetin vaikutusta päällysverkon eheyteen

		-Locality-awareness is considered as a promising approach to increase the efficiency of content distribution by peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, e.g., BitTorrent. 
		-It is intended to reduce the inter-domain traffic which is costly for Internet service providers (ISPs) and simultaneously increase the performance from the viewpoint of the 
		P2P users, i.e, shorten download times. 
		-This win-win situation should be achieved by a preferred exchange of information between peers which are located closely to each other in the underlying network topology. 
		-A set of studies shows that these approaches can lead to a win-win situation under certain conditions, and to a win-no lose situation in most cases. 
		-However, the scenarios used assume mostly homogeneous peer distributions and that all peers have the same access speed. 
		-This is not the case in practice according to several measurement studies. 
		-Therefore, we extend previous work in this paper by studying scenarios with real-life, skewed peer distributions and heterogeneous access bandwidths of peers. 
		-We show that even a win-no lose situation is difficult to achieve under those conditions and that the actual impact for a specific peer depends heavily on the used 
		locality-aware peer selection and the concrete scenario. 
		-Therefore, we conclude that current proposals need to be refined so that users of P2P networks can be sure that they also benefit from their use. 
		-Otherwise, a broad acceptance of the concept of locality-awareness in the user community of P2P networks will not take place.
		
		
		In contrast to the aforementioned work, we show in this paper that a win-no lose situation is difficult to achieve under the real-life conditions we observe in today’s 
		Internet
		
		Artikkelin pointit:
			-Paikallisuudesta hyötyvät lähinnä ISPt, p2p käyttäjät eivät (välttämättä) hyödy
				-Ratkaisut lupaavat win-win-tilanteita, mutta jopa win-no lose tilannetta on vaikeaa saavuttaa nykyisillä ratkaisuehdotuksilla
				
			-Tarkastelevat paikallisuutta erilaisessa skenaariossa kuin muut
				-Skewed peer distributions
					-Joissain verkoissa on paljon vertaisia ja joissain vähän
					-Ei siis oleteta että vertaiset jakautuneet tasaisesti
					-Käytettyjen lähteiden mukaan tälläinen tilanne on tyypilinen
					
				-Vertaisilla on eri yhteysnopeudet
				
				-Näillä kahdella tekijällä on suuret vaikutukset paikallisuuden toimivuuteen
				
			-Nykyiset paikallisuusratkaisut "introduce unfairness in the distribution process"
				-Joskus jopa vähentävät jakamisprosessin tehokkuutta
				-Eli paikallisuus haittaa käyttäjiä
				
			-Ratkaisuehdotuksiin siis tarvitaan parannuksia
				-Jos ei paranneta, niin p2p sovellukset kiertävät näitä paikallisuusominaisuuksia (esim. oraakkelia) mm. enkryptauksilal / käyttäjät eivät käytä paikallis-clienttejä
				
				
		-Artsassa suht hyvin selitetty BitTorrentin perusteita (lähteihin perustuens)

			-BU
				-[4]
					-Pushing the performance of biased neighbor selection through biased unchoking
				
		The main difference
		of Ono to the approaches described above is that it does not
		rely on a central entity which guides the inclusion of peers in
		the neighbor set of a peer. Instead, it uses the similarity of the
		redirection ratio of CDN servers as a metric describing how
		close peers are.
		
		In [12], the authors present three pitfalls for ISP-friendly
		P2P design: limited impact, reduced performance and robustness,
		and conflicting interests. They show that localityaware
		peer selection has no impact when there are only very
		few peers of a swarm in the same AS.
			The difference to
			this study is that we focus on the users’ point of view and
			simulate a BitTorrent swarm with detailed peer behaviors, e.g.,
			the choke algorithm with the tit-for-tat policy. In addition, we
			simulate the concrete implementations of locality-awareness
			mechanisms currently under discussion, i.e., BNS, BU, and
			the combination of both. In this way we show that different
			implementations lead to a different application performance,
			which is neglected in [12], and explain which users benefit
			in which scenarios by using BNS, BU, or the combination of
			them.
				
		Related to this, we formulate an interesting question we
		plan to investigate in more detail. Differences in user performances
		may lead to different users employing different locality
		promotion mechanisms and even switching between different
		schemes in the course of application operation. It is unclear
		how the entire system behaves under these circumstances.

	Abstract
		Peer-to-peer (P2P) locality has recently raised a lot of interest in the community. Indeed,
		whereas P2P content distribution enables financial savings for the content providers, it dramatically
		increases the traffic on inter-ISP links.
		To solve this issue, the idea to keep a fraction of the P2P traffic local to each ISP was introduced
		a few years ago. Since then, P2P solutions exploiting locality have been introduced.
		However, several fundamental issues on locality still need to be explored. In particular,
		how far can we push locality, and what is, at the scale of the Internet, the reduction of
		traffic that can be achieved with locality?
		In this paper, we perform extensive experiments on a controlled environment with up to
		10,000 BitTorrent clients to evaluate the impact of high locality on inter-ISP links traffic
		and peers download completion time.
		We introduce two simple mechanisms that make high locality possible in challenging
		scenarios and we show that we save up to several orders of magnitude inter-ISP traffic
		compared to traditional locality without adversely impacting peers download completion
		time. In addition, we crawled 214,443 torrents representing 6,113,224 unique peers spread
		among 9605 ASes. We show that whereas the torrents we crawled generated 11.6 petabytes
		of inter-ISP traffic, our locality policy implemented for all torrents could have
		reduced the global inter-ISP traffic by up to 40%

	Abstract
		This paper presents the measurement study of locality-
		aware P2P solutions over real-world Internet autonomous
		systems (AS) topology. By using the accesses of nodes of PlanetLab
		testbed, we create a detailed AS-level map including the
		end-to-end path of all nodes, as well as the relationship of all
		involved ASes. Based on this map, we evaluate the performance of
		a set of locality-aware P2P solutions, including an optimal solution
		guaranteeing the minimum AS hop count, as well as modified
		BitTorrent system with locality-awareness built into its neighbor

Mitigating unfairness in locality-aware peer-to-peer networks <------------------ KATO TÄTÄ TARKEMMIN

	Locality awareness is considered as a promising approach to increase the efficiency of content distribution
	by peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, e.g., BitTorrent. It is intended to reduce the inter-domain traffic, which is
	costly for Internet service providers (ISPs), and to simultaneously increase the performance from the
	viewpoint of P2P users, i.e., to shorten download times. This win–win situation should be achieved by a
	preferred exchange of information between peers which are located close to each other in the underlying
	network topology.Aset of studies shows that these approaches can lead to a win–win situation under certain
	conditions, and to a win–no lose situation in most cases. However, the scenarios used mostly assume
	homogeneous peer distributions. This is not the case in practice according to recent measurement studies.
	Therefore, we extend previous work in this paper by studying scenarios with real-life, skewed peer
	distributions. We show that even a win–no lose situation is difficult to achieve under those conditions and
	that the actual impact for a specific peer heavily depends on the used locality-aware peer selection and the
	specific scenario. This contradicts the principle of economic traffic management (ETM), which aims for a
	solution where all involved players benefit and consequently have an incentive to adopt locality awareness.
	Therefore, we propose and evaluate refinements of current proposals, allowing all users of P2P networks to
	be sure that their application performance is not reduced. This mitigates the unfairness introduced by current
	proposals which is a key requirement for a broad acceptance of the concept of locality awareness in the user
	community of P2P networks. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

MultiCache: An overlay architecture for information-centric networking

	Abstract
		It has become apparent for quite some time that the Internet has evolved from a network
		connecting pairs of end-hosts to a substrate for information dissemination. While this shift
		towards information centric networking has been clearly demonstrated by the proliferation
		of file sharing and content delivery applications, it has not been reflected in a corresponding
		shift in network architecture. To address this issue, we designed MultiCache,
		an information-centric architecture aiming at the efficient use of network resources.
		MultiCache is based on two primitives: multicast and caching. It exploits overlay multicast
		as a means for content delivery and takes advantage of multicast forwarding information to
		locate, in an anycast fashion, nearby caches that have been themselves fed via multicast.
		We evaluate MultiCache against a widespread file sharing application (BitTorrent) with
		respect to both network resource consumption and end-user experience

Cache Capacity Allocation to Overlay Swarms

    Abstract:
        Peer-to-peer applications generate huge volumes of Internet traffic, thus leading to higher congestion, as well as higher costs for the ISPs particularly due to inter-domain traffic. The traditional traffic management approaches employed by ISPs (e.g. traffic shaping or even throttling) often lead to a deterioration of users‟ Quality-of-Experience. Previous works have verified that the insertion of ISP-owned Peers (IoPs) can deal effectively with this situation. The mechanism offers caching while exploiting the self-organizing structure of overlays. Thus, it leads to both improved performance for peers and reduced inter-domain traffic costs for ISPs. In this paper, we study how the available IoP bandwidth capacity should be allocated among the various swarms that it can possibly join. In particular, we identify a variety of factors that influence the effectiveness of Swarm Selection and Bandwidth Allocation, and we investigate their impact on the practically relevant example of BitTorrent, primarily by means of simulations

    Abstract
        Peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing applications generate a large part of today’s Internet traffic. The largevolume of this traffic (thus high potential caching benefits) and the large cache sizes required (thus non-trivial costs associated with caching) only underline that efficient cache replacement policies are importantin this case. File popularity in P2P file-sharing networks does not follow Zipf’s law and several additionalcharacteristics set the generated traffic apart from well-studied Web traffic. All this lead us to conduct afocused study of efficient cache management policies for P2P file-sharing traffic. This paper uses real-worldtraces and trace driven simulations to compare traditional cache replacement policies and new policies thatexploit characteristics of the P2P file-sharing traffic generated by applications using FastTrack protocol

    Abstract
        Abstract—The Internet is witnessing explosive growth in traf-fic, in large part due to bulk transfers. Delivering such traffic isexpensive for ISPs because they pay other ISPs based on peakutilization. To limit costs, many ISPs are deploying ad-hoctrafficshaping policies that specifically target bulk flows. However, thereis relatively little understanding today about the effectiveness ofdifferent shaping policies at reducing peak loads and what impactthese policies have on the performance of bulk transfers.In this paper, we compare several traffic shaping policies withrespect to (1) the achieved reduction in peak network trafficand (2) the resulting performance loss for bulk transfers. Weidentified a practical policy that achieves peak traffic reductionsof up to 50% with only limited performance loss for bulktransfers. However, we found that the same policy leads to largeperformance losses for bulk transfers when deployed by multipleISPs along a networking path. Our analysis revealed that thisis caused by certain TCP characteristics and differences inlocalpeak utilization times.

    Abstract
        Peer-to-peer (P2P) content distribution sys-tems are a major source of traffic in the Inter-net, but the application layer protocols they useare mostly unaware of the underlying network inaccordance with the layered structure of theInternet’s protocol stack. Nevertheless, the needfor improved network efficiency and the businessinterests of Internet service providers (ISPs) areboth strong drivers toward a cross-layer approachin peer-to-peer protocol design, calling for P2Psystems that would in some way interact with theISPs. Recent research shows that the interaction,which can rely on information provided by bothparties, can be mutually beneficial. In this articlewe first give an overview of the kinds of informa-tion that could potentially be exchanged betweenthe P2P systems and the ISPs, and discuss theirusefulness and the ease of obtaining andexchanging them. We also present a classifica-tion of the possible approaches for interactionbased on the level of involvement of the ISPsand the P2P systems, and we discuss the poten-tial strengths and the weaknesses of theseapproaches.

    Abstract
        Abstract—We conduct a detailed simulation study to examinethe impact of localizing P2P traffic within network boundarieson an ISP’s profitability. A distinguishing aspect of our workis the focus on Internet-wide implications, i.e., how adoption oflocalization within an ISP affects both itself and other ISPs. Oursimulations are based on detailed models of inter-AS P2P trafficand inter-AS routing, localization models that can predicttheextent to which P2P traffic is reduced, and pricing models topredict the impact of changes in traffic on an ISP’s profit. Toevaluate our models we use a large-scale crawl of BitTorrentinvolving over 138 million users sharing 2.75 million files.Ourresults show that the benefits of localization must not be takenfor granted. Some of our key findings include: (i) residentialISPs can actually lose money when localization is employed andsome will not see increased profitability until other ISPs employlocalization; (ii) the reduction in costs due to localization will belimited for small ISPs and tends to grow only logarithmicallywith client population; and (iii) some ISPs can better increaseprofitability through alternate strategies to localization by takingadvantage of the business relationships they have with others

		Introduction
			-Theoverlay routing of peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic in the Internet, how-ever, may indirectly violate the business relationships of ISPs, asobserved in [3]

			-In addition, carrying P2P traffic through appli-cation overlays may introduce unexpected extra economic costto ISPs since P2P flows can travel across transit links to 
			reachthe demanded data, even if the content objects can be acquired inlocal ISPs.
				-Such a scenario can impose unnecessary extra trafficvolumes across domain boundaries that usually accounts for theInternet bottlenecks [4].

				-And the tussle is becoming even morechallenging with the proliferation of P2P-based applications,e.g., P2P-style video streaming [5] and emerging social mediaapplications, such as 
				Facebook/Pipe [6] and WebRTC [7].
				
			-A coordination between ISPs and P2P networks [4]–[10] hasbeen proposed as an efficient approach to deal with the tus-sle of P2P overlay and ISP underlay interaction, by 
			reducingsubstantial cross-ISP traffic while retaining desired P2P usersquality of experiences (QoE)
				- The basic idea is to provide alist of optimized peer candidates in proximity to each clientpeer by taking into account the context information providedby 
				overlay–underlay collaboration. 
					-Such an approach is of-ten known as thelocality-aware strategies(ornoncooperativestrategy).

		-Conclusion
			-In this paper, we develop a comprehensive analytical model-ing framework for multidomain peer selection, based on whichclosed forms of ISP efficiency, economic benefits, 
			and user ef-ficiency are derived. 
			-Based on this modeling framework, wepropose an advanced hybrid peer selection scheme, taking intoaccount of coexisting both cooperative and noncooperative ISPbehaviors in 
			practice. 
			-The theoretical framework facilitates sys-tematic analysis on different aspects of P2P system behaviors.
			-In particular, we have derived bound requirements for ISPs totarget in order to achieve desirable utilities for both ISPs andP2P systems. 
			-The numerical results show that the proposedmechanism is able to achieve significant performance gains forboth P2P systems and ISPs. 
			-Specifically, risks of potential con-gestions over critical inter-ISP links could be greatly alleviated,and possible failure operations of cooperation strategies couldbe 
			avoided as well.

		-Abstract
			-Internet   Service   Providers   (ISPs)   face   increasingbandwidth pressure from rising access demand by users, especiallyP2P and VoD applications. 
			-Traditionally, P2P has been viewed astremendously  negative  from  the  perspective  of  the  ISP.  
			-In  thispaper,  we  question  this  assumption  and  study  the  impact  of  P2Papplications  on  the  effective  ISP  functionality.  
			-We  perform  aneconomic analysis to show that a higher P2P penetration rate doesnot  necessarily  lead  to  increased  ISP  bottleneck  link  bandwidthpressure.  
			-Our  results  show  that  the  local  serving  rate  is  criticalfor the sustainability of the ISP business model as well as for thebenefit  of  P2P  users
			
		-Introduction
			-Since  it  is  unlikely  that  ISPs  can  truly  eliminate  P2P,  wewould argue that P2P users and ISPs need to find an equilibriumpoint  that  is  beneficial  to  both  
			sides.  
			-We  note  that  more  P2Papplications  do  not  necessarily  hurt  ISPs  since  higher  P2Ppenetration rate will likely increase content local serving rate.
			-With P2P traffic localization such as P4P [8], ISPs gain since data does not have to traverse the transit link and users gain aswell with lower latency. 
			-Motivated by the desire to seek for apossible mutually beneficial relationship between P2P and ISPs,we  model  their  interactions  in  a  game  theoretical  framework 
			and  solve  the  resulting  optimization  problem.  
			-We  show  thatthere exists a critical value of the local serving rate that wouldmake  ISPs  indifferent  with  or  without  P2P.  
			-The  fact  that  inreality  ISPs  usually  are  not  in  favor  of  P2P  implies  that  theactual  local  serving  rate  may  be  far  below  the  critical  level.
			-We  also  propose  the  concept  ofP2P botsthat  can  potentiallyaffect the local serving rate, i.e., the key determinant of P2P’snet effects on ISPs
			
		-Conclusion
			-As the amount of data transferred over the Internet increasesexponentially  in  the  big  data  era,  ISPs  face  bottleneck  band-width  pressure,  in  particular  from 
			P2P  applications.  
			-However,the  impact  of  P2P  on  ISPs  has  not  been  well  understood.
			-Through  modeling  analysis  and  simulation  study,  we  foundmore  P2P  users  may  not  necessarily  be  a  bad  thing  for  ISPs.
			-We  illustrate  the  direct  impact  of  the  key  determining  factor,the local serving rate of P2P, on the bottleneck link bandwidthand the business model of ISPs. 
			-We also explore the feasibilityof  potential  methods  to  increase  the  local  serving  rate.  
			-Ourequilibrium  solutions  suggest  it  would  be  mutually  beneficialfor  ISPs  to  localize  P2P  traffic,  which  will  allow  the  co-prosperity of both ISPs and P2P 
			networks.

		-Abstract
			-The proliferation of peer-to-peer applications has generated tremendous traffic inthe Internet backbone and has also posed unprecedented pressure on Internet Ser-vice 
			Providers. 
			-Many P2P applications, oblivious of underlying ISP networks, canlead to inefficient utilization of Internet resources and a significant amount of costlyinter-ISP traffic. 
			-Recently, increasing efforts have been directed toward mitigatingISP costs from P2P applications while preserving the user perceived service quality.
			-In this article we review state-of-the-art research on P2P applications with particularfocus on their topological properties and navigating algorithms with awareness of ISP 
			costs and performances. 
			-We discuss ISP-friendly designs in P2P applications byidentifying their respective benefits and deficiencies. 
			-Based on the lessons we havelearned, we further highlight future research challenges and issues regarding thejoint design and optimization of P2P system performance and ISP 
			traffic and costs
			
		-Introuduction
			- In particular, the keychallenge that has recently received significant attention inboth research and practice is that on one hand, many network-oblivious P2P 
			applications without awareness of ISP bound-aries can lead to inefficient utilization of Internet resourcesand poor system performance, as well as resulting in 
			immensecosts for ISPs due to the costly inter-ISP traffic; 
				-on the otherhand, current existing ISP-friendly P2P designs that aim to mit-igate inter-ISP traffic by optimizing peering locality could stillincur potential defects 
				in violating ISP policies and degradingthe robustness and performance of P2P applications.
			
		-Conclusion
			-Nowadays, one of the most pressingconcerns of ISPs is the disparitybetween P2P application overlayand  the  ISP  underlay  network, which can lead to costly inter-ISP 
			traffic and inefficient utilization ofnetwork resources. 
			-In this article wereview representative ISP-friendlydesigns that aim to mitigate ISP traffic costs and improve userperceived service quality. 
			-These objectives can be achieved viatopology navigation based on peer locality information, ISP-relevant information, and optimization algorithms regardingcost, 
			performance, and topology concerns. 
			-Caching proxiesdeployed at the boundaries of ISPs can also contribute to thereduction of costly inter-ISP traffic. 
			-Future research should bedirected toward cooperation between ISPs and P2P applica-tions, especially when ISPs can play dual roles of both networkprovider and content 
			provider. 
			-A collaborative caching schemewith regard to traffic cost and policy concerns of ISPs, and crit-ical performance metrics of P2P applications is desired in thefuture to 
			unify the targets of both sides.

				Pushing BitTorrent Locality to the limit
					Piatek et al. [23] discuss pitfalls for an ISP-friendly
					locality policy and ISPs traffic engineering constraints. In
					particular, Piatek et al. discuss three main issues: client
					side only localization might not work, localization might
					adversely impact robustness and efficiency, ISPs have conflicting
					interests. The two first issues do not apply to our
					work as we consider a tracker based locality policy, and
					as we have designed and evaluated the partition merging
					strategy to prevent robustness issues. Concerning the last
					issue on ISPs conflicting interests, it is beyond the scope of
					this study to evaluate the economical benefit for tier-1
					ISPs to keep traffic local. Our work shows that if ISPs want
					to apply a locality policy to BitTorrent traffic, it is doable
					and it will significantly reduce the traffic on inter-ISP
					links.

				Finally, based on a trace analysis,
				a recent study [22] shows that ISP-friendly based BitTorrent,
				such as Ono and P4P, may have limited performance gain, and
				may reduce robustness by focusing on reducing traffic for a
				single ISP.
				
				The significant amount of BT traffic on the Internet has
				caused ISPs to throttle, shape, or even block it. Targeting
				BT traffic reduction, researchers have proposed biased peer
				selection for BT systems by using network intelligence. Papers
				[3] and [15] suggested to select peers in the same ISP.
				The effectiveness of this approach is arguable considering 
				most BT peers are not in the same ISP [22] (22 = pitfalls).

			consider that P2P is a mechanism for content providers to shift distribution

		-> P2P rupesi enkryptaamaan pakettejaan
	
	-Eivät tehokkaita keinoja, tarvitaan yhteistyötä
		-P2P sovellukset keksivät ratkaisuja kiertämään yllämainittuja ongelmia
		
	-Recently, some ISPs have attempted to reduce P2P
	traffic by placing caches at the ISP’s gateway to the Internet or
	by using network appliances (e.g., Sandvine [28]) for spoofing
	TCP RST messages, which trick clients into closing connections
	to remote peers [28, 31]. The legality of these approaches is
	questionable. By caching content, ISPs may become participants in
	illegal distribution of copyrighted material, while interfering with
	P2P flows in a non-transparent way may not only break the law
	but also lead to significant backlash [11].

		-Vaikea estimoida ja reverse engineeraa verkon tietoja
	
	-A widely used ISP approach is to use traffic shaping devices to
	rate limit P2P (e.g., [6, 7, 19, 20, 28, 33]). These devices rely on
	deep packet inspection or other P2P traffic identification schemes
	(e.g., [11, 31]). Unilateral rate limiting by ISPs can be considered
	strong handed and may lead to P2P reactions such as encryption
	and dynamic ports to avoid being identified. Furthermore, techniques
	such as rate limiting, end-point usage-based charging, or
	priority are mainly for controlling edge traffic demands, not for improving
	network efficiency.

Vastaväitteitä lokalisaatiolle (ainakin suurten tiedostojen suhteen):
	-1. Tiedostot lyhytaikaisia, jälkeen vähemmän vertaisia, lokaliteetti ei enää niin hyödyllinen
	-2. Joillekin käyttäjille saattaisi olla nopeampaa ladata sisältöä verkon ulkopuolelta
	-3. Mahdolliset muutokset verkon ja sen reitityksen rakenteeseen
